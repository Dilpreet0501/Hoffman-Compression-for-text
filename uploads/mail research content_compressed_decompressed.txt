Subject:  Possible undergraduate research opportunities

Dear Professor Rajendra M. Sonar,

     I am Dilpreet Kaur Bhatia, a third year Electrical student  at NIT Raipur with a CGPA of 8.40 and I am writing to ask about opportunities for undergraduate research in your lab during the upcoming summer.I have been following your research closely, particularly Iken Solutions, and I am genuinely impressed by the innovative approach and contributions your work has made to the field of AI and Machine-Learning. As a student aspiring to pursue a career in Machine-Learning, I believe that a research internship under your guidance would provide me with invaluable experience and insights. 

I possess a strong background in python, C++ and machine learning. Some of my notable projects are potato disease detection which is used to detect diseases such as early blight and late blight with the help of its leaf photo. It is built using aspects of CNN, data augmentation and also uses different python libraries such as numpy, tensorflow and matplotlib.My other project is movie recommender system .It is a content-based recommender system which is used to filter out similar movies.It is built using cosine similarity with Scikit- learn , count vectorizer : a text preprocessing technique and uses different python libraries as numpy, pandas and ast .
 

I have attached my resume for your reference. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Dilpreet Kaur Bhatia
